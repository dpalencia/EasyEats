CSUN Comp 380 Recipe App

This was a group project for COMP 380 (Introduction to Software Engineering) at CSUN.  One of the main goals of this project in this class was to get familiar with Scrum and Agile software development methodologies. This work was done by a team of 4.

This is a mobile recipe app written in the Flutter framework that utilizes Firebase as a backend. This app is a recipe browser in which users can browse through recipes and see which recipes they can make given the ingredients they have on hand.

User accounts and authentication utilize Firebase Authentication servicce. The database for this app lives in a Cloud Firestore database, and the assets (images) are hosted on the Firebase backend as well.  Users can also browse through ingredients and add them to either of two lists which are tied to their user account: a shopping list and a "My Kitchen" list which represents the ingredients they currently have.
